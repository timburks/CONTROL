Agent I/O CONTROL

A portable container for networked applications.

On Linux (Ubuntu), CONTROL must be installed at /home/control.
This is performed automatically by the Ubuntu.sh setup script.


Installation:

0) Prepare a bare Linux installation. I like using 512MB 
   "Ubuntu 13.10 x64" images on Digital Ocean. If you
   use Digital Ocean, be sure to specify an SSH key
   when you create your instance and set your DNS
   records appropriately.

1) Download the Ubuntu.sh script to your instance.

> on your instance
% wget https://raw2.github.com/timburks/CONTROL/master/Ubuntu.sh

2) Run the Ubuntu.sh script to download and build all components
and start the CONTROL daemon.

> on your instance
% Ubuntu.sh

3) Copy your SSL certs onto your instance and restart it.

> remotely
% scp wildcard_agent_io.* root@hello.agent.io:/home/control/control/etc

> on your instance 
% /usr/sbin/nginx

4) Use the remote.nu script to set an admin username and password.

> remotely
% nush remote.nu
